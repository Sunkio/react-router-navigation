        "content":"I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

        "content":"I discovered StackUp only a few days ago and signed up wondering what to expect. I like the idea of submitting quests with the chance of winning a small reward. So far, Iâ€™ve taken part in 3 quests - the topics were React and Tableau. This React Router Navigation example page will be my fourth quest submission. The quests have been well-structured and fun to do, and I most certainly will take part in more quests in current and future challenges."
